### EDIT FROM 26/01/22: Rixyverse is now open-sourced. Please don't look at the code it's sooo bad that I cry when seeing it again.
### If you still wish contributing to this pretty dead shitty Miiverse Clone, you can open a pull request with changes you've made.

# Rixyverse
A brand-new from scratch Miiverse Clone!

# What do I need to run this?

### If you are going to self-host, or run on a server that you have full control over (dedicated server, VPS, etc.)
You'll need:

**-An Apache2 server**

**-PHP (that's logic)**

**-MySQL (or MariaDB)**

**-PhpMyAdmin**

First, download the project. Then, unpack the zip. Put the files into where you host the website, and setup the connect.php file You should be good to go.

----

### If you are using a hosting provider (please don't use 000webhost)

You won't need anything except the site files.

Download the project, and setup the connect.php file, and after that, upload the site files to your htdocs folder or whatever it is, and you should be good to go!
