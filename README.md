# Rixyverse
A brand-new from scratch Miiverse Clone!

# What I need to run this ?

Well, you need :

**-An Apache2 server**

**-PHP (that's logic)**

**-MySQL (or MariaDB)**

**-PhpMyAdmin**

First, download the whole project. Then, extract the content to /var/www/html/ or your Apache2 folder that you can put your PHP files on (I assume you have a Linux system to run this thing). After that, go to PhpMyAdmin and create a new db (or use an existing one) and import the DB Structure include in the archive. Finally, modifiy the file in /inc/connect.php to your MySQL (or MariaDB) ID and Password. (or eventually the host).

And you're good to go !
